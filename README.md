# WeSP-Editor
A simple program for creating and editing vector graphics (SVG) for the web.

I started this project because I wanted to make some vector graphics for a web and I thought it would be more fun to make my own program rather than learning to use something like Illustrator. It is also great for learning new stuff ^^.

### Some things on my To Do list:

- [ ] Commands:
  - [ ] Fully implement 'A'A (Elliptical Arc).
  - [ ] See if I should add the 'S' and 'T' commands as they are the reflexion of 'C' and 'Q'.
  - [ ] See if I add 'H' and 'V' or leave them as linetos, because you can use SHIFT for right angles is you need them.
- [x] Implement simple undo and redo.
- [ ] Implement better undo and redo.
- [ ] Improve mirroring points.
- [ ] Add path string optimizations to compress/shorten it as much as possible.
- [ ] Improve the interface.
- [ ] Implement paths and figures (subpaths) reordering.
- [ ] Points locking so you can't modify them accidentally.
- [ ] Background template images.
